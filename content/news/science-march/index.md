Gay Hyre of West Haven was among about 3,000 people who braved intermittent rain and chilly temperatures to join in the March for Science New Haven on April 22. The event was one of hundreds of marches worldwide on the 47th anniversary of Earth Day to protest President Donald J. Trump’s proposed cuts to research, public health, and environmental protection and his administration’s disdain for accepted scientific fact on such issues as climate change.

Unlike many in the crowd at College Woods in East Rock Park, Hyre was not a researcher, doctor, or scientist. Her reason for coming was personal. Medical science saved both her and husband’s lives, in her case from cancer, in his from a life-threatening accident.

If it wasn’t for science, both me and my husband wouldn’t be here,” Hyre said. “It’s too important not to be here.”

Overcast skies and occasional drizzles didn’t dampen the ardor of the protestors, who included Yale students, researchers and faculty members. They packed the park to listen to speeches, wave signs, and march about 1.5 miles through the city’s East Rock neighborhood. Among the messages on the numerous homemade placards: “Data not Demagoguery,” “Reality is Non-Negotiable” and “Don’t Let This Tweaker Take Away My Beaker.”

Robert Means, Ph.D., an associate research scientist in the School of Medicine’s pathology department, decked himself out in a lab coat on the back of which he wrote, “Defunding Science = Bad for Earth, Bad for Medicine, Bad for America.” The president’s proposed 18 percent cut in the budget for the National Institutes of Health would likely result in less money for his work, he said. “It seems there’s an unprecedented attack on scientific funding,” Means said.
