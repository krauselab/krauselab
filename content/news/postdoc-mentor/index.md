Diane Krause, MD, PhD, professor of laboratory medicine, of cell biology, and of pathology, has received the 2018 Yale Postdoctoral Mentoring Prize, awarded annually by the Office of the Provost to a faculty member who exemplifies the role of a mentor and who has provided exceptional mentoring to one or more postdoctoral scholars during the previous year.

Associate Provost Karen Anderson presented the award to Krause, who also is associate director of the Yale Stem Cell Center and of the Transfusion Medicine Service, and medical director of the Clinical Cell Processing Laboratory and of the Advanced Cell Therapy Laboratory. Anderson praised Krause’s lab for propelling postdocs toward ladder faculty positions in academia at a higher than average rate—largely, she said, because Krause is not only effective at identifying young scientists who will be successful, but also takes special care to focus on their growth, guiding them toward achieving their professional goals

“Science is what drives me,” said Krause as she accepted the honor. “That extends to what truly drives the science—the people in my lab,” who work toward defining molecular mechanisms related to blood stem and progenitor cells and leukemia, and developing novel treatment strategies.
