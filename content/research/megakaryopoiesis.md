Megakaryocytes (Mk) are truly one of the most fascinating cell types in the body.  After a 2N cell commits to the Mk lineage, it undergoes polyploidization (replication of its nuclear DNA without cell division) and then undergoes tremendous cytoskeletal rearrangements to become amongst the largest cells in the body jam packed with membranes and actin cytoskeletal components that then undergo proplatelet formation followed by release of about ~1000 functional platelets per Mk. Due to the physiological need for platelets for blood clotting, the average adult produces over 100 million megakaryocytes and releases over 10e11 platelets per day (thatâ€™s over 1 million platelets per second)! The Krause lab is elucidating the transcriptional mechanisms of megakaryocyte maturation with a focus on the role of the cytoskeleton, MKL1 and other transcription factors.
