*Unless noted otherwise, all incubations take place at room temperature*

1. Equilibrate frozen sections to RT
2. Wash in 2xSSC, incubate two times, 3 min each incubation (2x3min)
3. Incubate in 0.2 M HCL for 10 min at room temperature
4. Wash in 2xSSC 2x3min
5. Incubate in 1M NaSCN for 20 min at 75-80°C
6. Wash in 2xSSC 2x3min
7. Water rinse
8. Ethanol dehydrate (70%, 95%, 100%), 1 min each
9. Air-dry slides
10. **Hybridization:** pre-heat probe to 75°C, vortex to mix  
  a. Add 10-12 µl preannealed probe to slides and cover with a small coverslip (18mmx18mm).  
  b. Seal with rubber cement - must be certain that edges of coverslip are sealed completely (can't use too much!)  
  c. Incubate @ 75°C for 5 min.  
  d. Incubate @ 37°C overnight in moist chamber  
11. Carefully remove rubber cement and coverslip, wash in 2xSSC 2 min
12. Wash with 0.4x SSC/0.3%NP40 at 55 C for 3 min.
13. Wash 2xSSC 2 min
14. **Block:** incubate in 4xSSC/3%BSA/0.1%Tween20 for 30 min at 37°C
15. **Detection:** dilute anti DIG-rhodamine (Roche cat# 1 207 750) 1:20 in 4xSSC/1%BSA/0.1%Tween20 and incubate at 37°C for 45 min.
16. Wash well with 2xSSC
17. Rinse slides in water
18. Air-dry slides in the dark
19. Add a drop of vectashield mounting medium with DAPI (Vector cat# H-1200), coverslip and view.
