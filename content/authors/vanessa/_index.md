Dr. Vanessa Scanlon, Instructor, began her research journey as a research assistant while pursuing her bachelor’s degrees at the University of Connecticut (UCONN) in Rachel O’Neil’s lab studying retrotransposable elements in eutherian hybrid genomes. Her experience in basic research coupled with her dedication to clinical diagnostics gained from two years working as a Cytogenetic Technologist at a large nationwide reference laboratory, compelled her to pursue a PhD in Biomedical Science at UCONN Health. During her PhD training in the laboratory of Dr. Archana Sanjay, she delved into key intracellular signaling events imperative for proper bone fracture healing in periosteal progenitor cells and bone marrow stromal cells. After publishing two first author papers, her curiosity about the bone marrow microenvironment led her to pursue her postdoctoral studies in the field of hematopoiesis in the Krause lab. Her long term research interests include better understanding the intracellular signaling events and cell-cell interactions between bone marrow stromal and hematopoietic cells that regulate steady state hematopoiesis and bone turnover, as well as the molecular mechanisms underlying pathological conditions of the bone marrow microenvironment.
