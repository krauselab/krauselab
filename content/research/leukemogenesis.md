Improper development of megakaryocytes leads to Acute Megakaryoblastic Leukemia (AMKL), a deadly variant of Acute Myeloblastic Leukemia (AML) characterized by increased blasts in the marrrow. To better understand the healthy and cancerous development of these cells, we focus primarily on two genes, RBM15 and MKL1, that are fused in the t(1;22) translocation often observed in AMKL patients.

To study RBM15 and MKL1, we use patient-derived cells, murine and human embryonic stem cells, and a broad array of methods. Ongoing work on RBM15 is focused on m6A methylation, RNA stability, transcription and notch signaling. MKL1, also part of the t(1;22) translocation specific to acute megakaryoblastic leukemia, activates the transcription factor serum response factor (SRF). Ongoing work on MKL1 is focused on the mechanisms by which MKL1 promotes megakaryocytopoiesis.

Our goal is that by better understanding these two genes, we will learn more about the carefully orchestrated process of blood cell development and the ways this process breaks down in AMKL.
