## Directed epithelial differentiation
#### Developing translational applications for directed differentiation of lung epithelium

In early 2000, the Krause laboratory discovered that bone marrow derived cells are capable of differentiating into non-hematopoietic cells throughout the body. In 2001, we published our finding that a single bone marrow derived cell could engraft the hematopoietic system and differentiate into mature epithelial cells in mice, and in 2002, we published that the same occurs in humans. The nonhematopoietic (non-blood) cell types that we focused on were epithelial cells in the lung, liver, GI tract and skin.

Since that time, we have focused on several important questions regarding this plasticity including which nonhematopoietic cell populations in the bone marrow are responsible and how these cells are regulated. We have shown that bone marrow transplantation leads to amelioration of renal mesangial sclerosis, and that bone marrow derived cells can engraft as functional epithelial cells in the GI tract and lungs (specifically the alveoli) of mice. In studies to determine the mechanism(s) by which BM cells become epithelial cells, we have discovered that this involves at least 2 different mechanisms, one involving cell fusion and the other not. Fusion is quite rare.  In contrast, we have proven that nonhematopoietic cells in the bone marrow (and perhaps elsewhere), are responsible for engraftment as mature type II pneumocytes in the lung without cell fusion.  Future questions that we want to address include determining the identity of the bone marrow derived cells that are responsible, and determining the mechanisms by which they differentiate into epithelial cells without cell fusion. Our current studies are focused primarily on lung repair.
