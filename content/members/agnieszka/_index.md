Agnieszka Brojakowska, an MD-PhD candidate in the Department of Cell Biology, graduated from Skidmore College in 2017 with a B.A. in Molecular and Cellular Biology and a minor in Computer Science. Following her undergraduate studies, Agnieszka worked as a medical scribe and researcher at the Cardiovascular Research Institute at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. During her time, she focused on elucidating the effects of ionizing radiation on cardiovascular disease risks. During the COVID-19 pandemic, she led and operationalized the convalescent plasma program during the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, which ultimately resulted in the development of HIG at Mount Sinai. At that time, she was exposed to clonal hematopoiesis, budding her interest in investigating the relationship of hematopoiesis in cardio-oncology. As an MD/PhD candidate, Agnieszka joined the Krause lab in September 2024 to explore mechanisms driving hematopoietic fate and clonal stability.
