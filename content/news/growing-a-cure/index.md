# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: “What do you think?" It was eight years ago. Dr. Julie Ann Sosa and Dr. Sanziana Roman, two leading endocrine surgeons, approached Dr. Diane Krause about growing new parathyroid cells in the lab. They wanted to treat patients — mostly women — suffering from a lack of the hormone these cells produce."

“What do you think?" It was eight years ago. Dr. Julie Ann Sosa and Dr. Sanziana Roman, two leading endocrine surgeons, approached Dr. Diane Krause about growing new parathyroid cells in the lab. They wanted to treat patients — mostly women — suffering from a lack of the hormone these cells produce."

Dr. Krause, an internationally recognized stem cell researcher, was immediately intrigued.

“I thought, ‘You know what — that sounds like a good idea,’” Krause said. “But was it even feasible?”

Thanks to a pair of pilot grants from Women’s Health Research at Yale, we now know the answer is, “Yes, it is feasible.” Moreover, while the team has not yet reached their ultimate goal, they have successfully achieved critically important steps in guiding a stem cell down the path to becoming a functional parathyroid-like cell. And with new funding from WHRY this year, Krause and her collaborators continue to move closer to a cure for this condition, known as hypoparathyroidism.

“Patients contact me every week,” Krause said. “They want us to succeed. They need the breakthroughs. And that’s what keeps us going.”
