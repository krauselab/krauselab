**The goal of the Krause Laboratory** is to define how stem and progenitor cells balance and regulate fate decisions in health and disease. We study stem cells to improve strategies for repair and regeneration of the hematopoietic system as well as solid organs including the lung and parathyroids. Situated in the Yale Stem Cell Center at the Yale School of Medicine, we develop cellular models of hematopoiesis using bone marrow derived stem and progenitor cells. With Diane serving as Medical Director of the Advanced Cell Therapy Laboratory, the lab is uniquely situated to translate insights from basic research into improved strategies for bone marrow and stem cell transplantation and novel treatments for leukemia and lymphoma.
