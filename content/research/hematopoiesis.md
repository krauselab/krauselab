The majority of research in the Krause Lab focuses on identifying the molecular mechanisms that regulate hematopoiesis in the megakaryocyte lineage and how failure of these mechanisms contributes to leukemogenesis.

Although a healthy human undergoes typical hematopoiesis within this lineage, improper development of megakaryocytes leads to Acute Megakaryoblastic Leukemia (AMKL), a deadly variant of Acute Myeloblastic Leukemia (AML) characterized by high percentage of blasts in the megakaryocyte lineage. To better understand the healthy and cancerous development of these cells, we focus primarily on two genes, RBM15 and MKL1, that are fused in the t(1;22) translocation often observed in AMKL patients.

To study RBM15 and MKL1, we use patient-derived cells, murine and human embryonic stem cells, and a broad array of methods. We have pioneered techniques for time-lapse imaging of the dynamics of differentiation in individual Megakaryocytic-Erythroid Progenitor cells (see video above). The Krause lab has also developed immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence methods that aid in high-throughput characterization of differentiation markers. In our ongoing research, we are applying cutting edge genomic approaches like single cell RNA-sequencing to finely study transcriptomic changes during the dynamic processes of hematopoiesis and leukemogenesis. Ongoing work on RBM15 is focused on the mechanisms by which it affects notch signaling, its RNA binding properties, ands its ability to bind to other nuclear proteins to affect transcription.

Our research has shown that when RBM15 is overexpressed, it prevents myeloid differentiation, and when RBM15 is inhibited or deleted, myeloid differentiation is enhanced and there is a loss of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells. RBM15 is a member of the spen family of proteins that share a C-terminal SPOC domain that bind to the nuclear corepressor complex. We have shown that RBM15 represses Notch induced Hes1 promoter activity [(Ma, X. et al. 2007)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17283045).  Also, RBM15, which is an RNA binding protein, plays a role in post-transcriptional changes to RNA icnluding splicing and methylation. Thus, RBM15 plays a role in hematopoiesis by maintaining myeloid cells in an undifferentiated state, and this activity is potentially mediated by regulation of Notch signaling and/or RNA processing.

MKL1, also part of the t(1;22) translocation specific to acute megakaryoblastic leukemia,  activates the transcription factor serum response factor (SRF). The Krause laboratory has shown that MKL1 expression is upregulated during megakaryocytic differentiation, and that overexpression of MKL1 enhances megakaryocytic differentiation.  The effect of MKL1 is abrogated when SRF is knocked down, suggesting that MKL1 acts through SRF. Knock out of MKL1 in mice leads to reduced platelet counts, and reduced ploidy in bone marrow megakaryocytes. Thus, MKL1 promotes physiological maturation of human and murine megakaryocytes. Ongoing work on MKL1 is focused on the mechanisms by which MKL1 promotes megakaryocytopoiesis.

Our hope is that by better understanding these two genes, we will learn more about the carefully orchestrated process of blood cell development and the ways this process breaks down in AMKL.
