The Yale Advanced Cell Therapy (ACT) laboratory is a state-of-the-art laboratory designed for the production of high quality, safe, cell products for clinical treatment. The ACT is dedicated to and responsible for the production of cellular products to be used in phase I/II clinical trials conducted by investigators at Yale and in multicenter trials. Our laboratory has significant experience with IND-enabling studies using Good Manufacturing Practices. Cell product safety and quality are the top priorities for our laboratory. The ACT assures that all government regulations are met, that all products meet defined release criteria, and that all products are safe for administration to patients.

All steps of manufacturing are controlled by Standard Operating Procedures, overseen by QA/QC, and performed in our facility by qualified personnel. Cells for clinical research are isolated, expanded, tested, certified and released using validated best practices. To support clinical investigation in the field of cellular therapy the ACT Laboratory is located directly adjacent to the Transfusion Medicine Division and the Clinical Blood Bank for Yale New Haven Hospital.
