The parathyroid glands are small (the size of a grain of rice) tissues located adjacent to the thyroid gland in the neck.  Patients with hypoparathyroidism lack parathyroid gland function. Without these glands and the hormone they produce, called parathyroid hormone (PTH), levels of calcium in the bloodstream drop. This calcium deficiency can lead to serious health problems, including painful muscle spasms in the hands and feet, seizures, an irregular heartbeat, or even heart failure. Patients also suffer on a daily basis due to fatigue and ‘brain fog,’ a less well understood aspect of the disease. Current treatments require regular calcium supplements that can be short-acting and trigger unwanted side effects, making it difficult for patients to sustain a proper balance. The most common cause of hypoparathyroidism is that these glands are removed during surgery for thyroid cancer. To be sure that no malignant tissue remains, such surgery often involves removing the parathyroid gland. Other causes of hypoparathyroidism include autoimmune diseases and hereditary conditions that lead to depleted levels of PTH.

The Krause laboratory along with collaborators across the country has taken the first steps toward transforming stem cells into parathyroid cells that can serve the same function as intact parathyroid glands. Building on earlier published efforts, the team has discovered that the completed process will need to encompass five stages of specialization from an undifferentiated stem cell to a fully functioning parathyroid-like cell. Each step involves inducing the cell to express the specific genes necessary to guide the process in the desired direction.
