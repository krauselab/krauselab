Lin Wang has been a Research Associate in the Krause's laboratory for over 20 years. She received her Master’s Degree from the University of New Haven in molecular/cellular biology.  She is highly trained in molecular/cellular biology, protein biochemistry and cell culture including primary murine and human cells.  Her interests outside of the laboratory include her family, gardening, hiking, backpacking, photography (including aerial photography), and volunteering for the community. She has been bagged 40 out of the 48 ‘high peaks’ in New Hampshire, and has climbed more than half of the 4000 ft peaks (total 115) in the northeastern US. Both science and nature make life fun!
