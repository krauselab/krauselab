More than any other scientific field, with the possible exception of climate change, embryonic stem cell research is subject to the ups and downs of politics and trouble may lie ahead for scientists in Connecticut and across the country.

Derived from early embryos, embryonic stem cells can become any cell in the body. Since the discovery of human embryonic stem cells in 1998, scientists have explored their potential use as therapies for diseases and injuries. Embryonic stem cell derivatives, for example, could replace the pancreatic cells lost in Type I Diabetes or the neurons lost in Parkinson's Disease. But just as this approach begins to show promise, a new threat appears on the horizon.

U.S. Rep. Tom Price, R-Ga., Donald Trump's nominee to head the Department of Health and Human Services with oversight over the National Institutes of Health, is on record opposing embryonic stem cell research. As stem cell researchers, we fear that this appointment would endanger human embryonic stem cell research in the United States and reverse the substantial progress made in recent years. There are promising clinical trials underway for macular degeneration, spinal cord injury and diabetes with more possible, including for Parkinson's disease.

Connecticut has recognized the importance of human embryonic stem cell research and funded first the Connecticut Stem Cell Program, and now the Regenerative Medicine Research Fund. This brought Connecticut to the forefront of stem cell research. Continued support at the national level is also needed, however, if we wish to continue making progress toward effective cell-based therapies.
