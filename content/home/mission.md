*The goal of the Krause Laboratory is to understand the molecular mechanisms that define hematopoiesis and leukemogenesis. Situated in the Yale Stem Cell Center at the Yale School of Medicine, we develop dynamic cellular models of hematopoiesis using bone marrow derived stem and progenitor cells. With Diane also serving as Medical Director of the Advanced Cell Therapy Laboratory, our group is uniquely situated to translate insights from our basic research into improved strategies for bone marrow and stem cell transplantation. Our group also further applies our research to develop novel strategies for treating leukemia and lymphoma.*
